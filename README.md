# Chess Engine using Stockfish Score Evaluations

A pygame GUI chess game where users have the option to play against each another or against an engine. The engine was trained using Stockfish engine evaluations on over 300+ positions from Lichess Database and built with a CNN regression architecture that predicts evaluation scores. It searches for the best move based on the highest evaluation score generated by the CNN model for the current position and pushes that move to the board. 

## Demo








## Set up instructions

Clone repo first 

1.  Set up Virtual Environment

Mac/Linux 

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. install required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. run main file

```bash
cd Chess_GUI/src/
python main.py
```

## Usage

1. press 't' on keyboard to change the theme of the board
2. press 'r' on keyboard to restart
3. press 'c' on keyboard to play against AI


### Limitations/future optimizations

- Improve the precision of eval scores:
    - Add an extra channel for better interpretability 
    - Increase the amount of layers or adjust filter size to capture more patterns
    - Incorporate higher quality games such as grandmaster/elite level games for better score accuracy and move output
- Enable functionality for the engine to play as white
- Fix piece move bugs and any existing bugs
- Use minimax algorithm to provide the engine with higher search depth and better accuracy
